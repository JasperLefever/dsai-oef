    "# Lab time series analysis: golden cross\n",
    "\n",
    "A *Golden Cross* is the name of a pattern that is used in the technical analysis of stock prices. A Golden Cross occurs when a short-term moving average breaks above a long-term moving average. This is an indicator for the potential of a major rally on the stock (*bull market*). The long-term moving average is then considered to be a \"resistance level\", i.e. when the stock price drops towards that level, it will often quickly bounce up again.\n",

    "The dataset `SP500.csv` contains among others the closing price of the Standard & Poors 500, a stock market index tracking the performance of 500 large publicly traded companies in the USA. The data was collected by Hoseinzade & Haratizadeh (2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import the CSV-file in a DataFrame, parse the `Date` column as a date and set it as the index. We will only use the variable `Close`, so you can drop all other variables.\n",

    "Traders often use moving averages when analysing the evolution of stock prices. Specifically, the 50-day moving average is the average price over the last 10 trading weeks, making it a commonly used support level. Likewise, the 200-day moving average represents the average price over the past 40 weeks, which is used to suggest a relatively cheap price compared to the price range over most of the past year.\n",
