    "### Exercise 1 - Retrieval practice: measurement levels\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement levels are an important concept in descriptive statistics because most visualization and analysis techniques depend on this. It is therefore important to know and understand the different measurement levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval practice is a study technique that has been scientifically proven to be effective and which leads to improved learning outcomes (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take a blank sheet of paper and try to reproduce an overview of all measurement levels without consulting the syllabus or other sources. Describe the specific properties for each measurement level and give some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Take enough time for this (e.g. at least 5 to 10 minutes). Do not immediately look into the syllabus, but try to remember as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you are done with this, indicate everything that you have noted so far with an (e.g. green) marker.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If possible, consult with a fellow student and try to complete the overview that you have each made. Mark all additions with a marker in a different color (e.g. yellow).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally, verify your notes using the syllabus and correct/complete incorrect or missing information if necessary. Indicate this in a third color (e.g. orange or red).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the highlighted colors in your notes, you now have an overview of what you already know and what you need to study. Repeat this exercise a number of times during the course of the semester.  Never start by looking at the result of a previous attempt, but immediately try to retrieve as much information as possible from your memory on a blank sheet. Compare the results afterwards. You should notice that over time, you will mark more and more in green and you will use less red or even none at all."
